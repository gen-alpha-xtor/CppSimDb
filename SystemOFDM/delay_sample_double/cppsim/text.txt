module: delay_sample_double
description: design a time-delay filter: delta[n-delay]. delay must be an integer.
parameters: int delay 
inputs: double in
outputs: double out
classes: Filter filt("1-z^-1","1")
static_variables:
init:
  filt.set("z^-no","1","no",delay);
code:
  filt.inp(in);
  out = filt.out;
